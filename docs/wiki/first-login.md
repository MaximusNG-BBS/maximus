You've installed Maximus, the files are in place, and you're ready to see it
run. The very first thing to do is log in locally and create your sysop
account. This initializes the user database and gives you the master account
with full system privileges. Until this is done, remote callers can't connect.

It only takes a minute.

---

## Step 1: Launch in Local Console Mode

```bash
cd $PREFIX
bin/runbbs.sh -c
```

This starts the BBS right on your terminal — no telnet, no MaxTel, just you
and the login screen, exactly as a caller would see it.

---

## Step 2: Create Your Sysop Account

1. **Enter your sysop name.** Use the exact name you configured in
   `config/maximus.toml` (the `sysop_name` field). The BBS sees that no user
   exists with that name and walks you through new-user registration.

2. **Set a password.** Pick something strong — this account has the keys to
   everything. If password encryption is enabled (and it should be), the
   password is hashed before storage.

3. **Answer the profile questions.** Location, terminal type, screen size —
   the usual new-user prompts. Don't overthink these; you can change them all
   later from the Change Settings menu or from MaxCFG's
   [User Editor]({% link maxcfg-user-editor.md %}).

4. **Log off cleanly.** Press **G** (Goodbye) from the main menu. This
   ensures your account is fully written to the database.

The BBS automatically grants your account the highest privilege level because
the name matches the configured sysop name. You're now the sysop.

## What Happened Behind the Scenes

- **User database initialized.** The SQLite database at `data/users/user.db`
  was created on first run (by `bin/init-userdb.sh`). If it already existed,
  it wasn't overwritten.

- **Sysop privilege assigned.** The name you entered was matched against
  `maximus.sysop_name` in your config, and the account was given the
  configured sysop access level automatically.

- **Node state files created.** Per-node working files appeared under `run/`
  for your console session. These are ephemeral — they're recreated each time
  a node starts.

---

## Step 3: Verify and Go Remote

```bash
# Confirm the user database exists
ls -la data/users/user.db

# Start MaxTel and test a remote login
bin/maxtel -p 2323 -n 1
# In another terminal: telnet localhost 2323
```

If you can log in remotely with the account you just created, you're done.
Your BBS is live.
