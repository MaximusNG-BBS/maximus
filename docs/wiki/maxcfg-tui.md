If you've ever used RemoteAccess Config or KBBS Setup, MaxCFG's TUI will feel
immediately familiar. It's an ncurses-based configuration editor — menus,
forms, list pickers, tree views, color pickers, and a full menu editor with
[live preview]({% link maxcfg-menu-editor.md %}#live-preview). Everything is
keyboard-driven, and you can configure your entire BBS without touching a
single config file by hand.

This page covers the screen layout, navigation keys, and general editing
concepts. The individual editor pages (linked from the menu tables below) go
into detail on each section.

## Launching

```bash
# Launch with auto-detected sys_path
maxcfg

# Launch with an explicit sys_path
maxcfg /opt/maximus
```

If no `sys_path` is given, MaxCFG tries to resolve it from the binary location
or the TOML configuration. The sys_path must contain a `config/` directory with
the TOML configuration files.

## Screen Layout

![MaxCFG Screen Layout]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-setup-bbs-info.png)

- **Title bar** (top) — application name, version, and help hint
- **Menu bar** — six top-level menus with dropdown and cascading submenus
- **Work area** — where forms, pickers, and editors appear
- **Status bar** (bottom) — context-sensitive key hints

## Navigation Keys

### Menu Bar

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Left / Right** | Switch between top-level menus |
| **Up / Down** | Navigate within a dropdown |
| **Enter** | Select item or open submenu |
| **Esc** | Close dropdown / return to menu bar |
| **First letter** | Jump to matching menu item |

### Form Editor

Forms are the primary editing interface — you'll spend most of your time in
them. Each form has labeled fields with editable values.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Up / Down** | Move between fields |
| **Tab / Shift+Tab** | Next / previous field |
| **Enter** | Edit text field, open picker, or invoke action |
| **F2** | Open picker (same as Enter for select/file/action fields) |
| **Space** | Cycle toggle value (Yes/No or multi-option) |
| **F10** | Save and close form |
| **Esc** | Cancel — prompts to save if changes were made |

### List Picker

List pickers show a scrollable list of items — protocols, addresses, areas,
users, and more. They all work the same way:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Up / Down** | Navigate items |
| **Enter** | Edit selected item |
| **Insert** or **+** | Insert new item |
| **Delete** or **-** | Delete or toggle-disable item |
| **/** | Set filter text |
| **C** | Clear filter |
| **Home / End** | Jump to first / last item |
| **PgUp / PgDn** | Page scroll |
| **Esc** | Close list (saves if applicable) |

### Tree View

Tree views show the message and file area hierarchy as a collapsible outline.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Up / Down** | Navigate nodes |
| **Right** | Expand a division node |
| **Left** | Collapse a division node |
| **Enter** | Edit the selected node |
| **Insert** | Add a sibling node |
| **Delete** | Toggle enable/disable |
| **Esc** | Save and exit tree view |

---

## Field Types

Forms use several field types, each with its own editing behavior:

| Type | Visual Cue | How to Edit |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Text** | Editable text | Enter to start typing, max length enforced |
| **Number** | Numeric value | Enter to type, validated as integer |
| **Toggle** | `Yes`/`No` or option list | Space or Enter cycles through options |
| **Select** | Value with dropdown | Enter/F2 opens a picker popup |
| **File** | Path string | Enter/F2 opens file browser; Space for manual edit |
| **Multiselect** | Checkbox list | Enter/F2 opens checkbox picker |
| **Action** | Button label | Enter/F2 invokes an action (opens sub-form, picker, etc.) |
| **Separator** | Horizontal rule | Non-interactive; groups related fields visually |

---

## Saving Changes

MaxCFG edits an in-memory copy of the TOML configuration. Changes are **not**
written to disk until you explicitly save:

- **Individual forms** — pressing **F10** writes changes for that form back to
  the in-memory TOML. The form title shows a dirty indicator when unsaved
  changes exist.

- **Tools → Save Configuration** — writes all accumulated in-memory changes to
  the TOML files on disk. This is the final commit step.

- **Area trees** (Messages/Files) — area editors save directly to
  `areas/msg/areas.toml` or `areas/file/areas.toml` when you exit the tree
  view or list picker.

- **User editor** — changes are written directly to the SQLite user database
  when you confirm each sub-form.

- **Text lists** (Bad Users, Reserved Names) — saved to their respective text
  files when you exit the list editor.

If you **Esc** out of a form with unsaved changes, you are prompted:

![MaxCFG Abort Changes Dialog]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-tui-abort.png)

---

## Path Handling

Many forms include path fields (display files, language files, log files, etc.).
MaxCFG normalizes these relative to `sys_path`:

- **Absolute paths** are stored and displayed as-is
- **Relative paths** are resolved under `sys_path` (e.g., `ansi/logo` becomes
  `/opt/maximus/ansi/logo`)
- **MEX paths** (ending in `.vm`) are resolved under `scripts/`

The display shows paths in their shortest relative form when possible. Missing
files are flagged with a warning indicator.
