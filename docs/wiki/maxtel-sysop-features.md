MaxTel's interactive dashboard isn't just for watching — it gives you direct
control over your nodes. You can snoop on active sessions, kick problem users,
restart misbehaving nodes, and even launch the configuration editor without
leaving MaxTel.

All sysop commands operate on the **currently selected node**. Use `↑`/`↓` or
the number keys (`1`–`9`) to select a node first, then press the command key.

## Keyboard Command Reference

| Key | Command | What It Does |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| `S` | Snoop | Attach to the selected node's session — see and type what the user sees |
| `C` | Config | Launch the MaxCFG editor inline (MaxTel suspends until you exit) |
| `K` | Kick | Terminate the selected node's session immediately |
| `R` | Restart | Kill and respawn the selected node |
| `Q` | Quit | Shut down MaxTel and all nodes gracefully |

> **Note:** In compact mode (80×25), the `S` key for Snoop is not shown in the
> status bar due to space constraints, but it still works.

## Snoop Mode

Snoop mode lets you watch an active session in real time — exactly what the
caller sees on their screen. You can also type into the session, which means
you can interact with Maximus as if you were the caller. This is invaluable
for troubleshooting user issues, testing menu flows, or just keeping an eye
on things.

### Entering Snoop Mode

1. Select a node that has an active session (status **Online**)
2. Press `S`

MaxTel exits the dashboard temporarily and drops you into a raw terminal view
of that node's PTY. You'll see a header bar at the top:

![MaxTel Snoop Mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxtel-snoop-mode.png)

Everything the caller sees now appears on your screen. Everything you type
goes to the session — the caller sees your keystrokes too.

### Snoop Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F1` | Exit snoop mode and return to the dashboard |
| `F2` | Send Alt-C to the session (triggers the Maximus sysop chat toggle) |

All other keystrokes pass through to the node's session directly.

### What Happens When the Session Ends

If the caller disconnects or the node exits while you're snooping, MaxTel
detects the closed PTY and returns you to the dashboard automatically.

## Inline Config Editor

Pressing `C` from the dashboard launches MaxCFG — the Maximus configuration
editor — right in your terminal. MaxTel suspends its own display, hands the
terminal over to MaxCFG, and waits.

When you exit MaxCFG, MaxTel reclaims the terminal and redraws the dashboard.
No restart needed — any configuration changes you made take effect the next
time a node spawns or Maximus reloads its config.

> **Tip:** This is especially handy when you're running MaxTel in a remote SSH
> session and need to tweak settings without opening another terminal.

---

## Kick

Pressing `K` terminates the selected node's Maximus process immediately. The
caller's connection is dropped and the node returns to an available state.

Use this when:

- A user is stuck or unresponsive
- A session is misbehaving
- You need to free up a node quickly

The node becomes available for new connections right away — MaxTel does not
automatically respawn a kicked node. If you want the node back in WFC
(Waiting For Caller) state, use **Restart** instead.

---

## Restart

Pressing `R` kills the selected node's Maximus process and immediately
respawns it. The node cycles through **Stopping** → **Starting** → **WFC**
and is ready for new callers within a few seconds.

Use this when:

- A node is stuck in a bad state
- You've made configuration changes and want a fresh Maximus instance
- A node process crashed and didn't clean up properly
