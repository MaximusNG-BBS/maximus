MaxTel has three operating modes: interactive (the default), headless, and
daemon. Which one you use depends on how you want to manage your BBS.

---

## Command-Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-p PORT` | TCP port to listen on | `2323` |
| `-n NODES` | Number of nodes to manage (1–32) | `4` |
| `-d PATH` | Base directory for the Maximus installation | current directory |
| `-m PATH` | Path to the `max` binary | `./bin/max` |
| `-c PATH` | Path to the TOML config base | `config/maximus` |
| `-s COLSxROWS` | Request a specific terminal size (e.g., `132x60`) | auto-detect |
| `-H` | Headless mode — no UI | off |
| `-D` | Daemon mode — fork to background (implies `-H`) | off |
| `-h` | Print usage and exit | — |

### Quick Examples

```bash
# 8 nodes on the standard telnet port (needs root for port 23)
maxtel -p 23 -n 8

# Point at a specific Maximus installation
maxtel -d /opt/maximus -p 2323

# Force a wide terminal for the dashboard
maxtel -s 132x60

# Run headless on a server
maxtel -H -p 2323 -n 4

# Daemonize for unattended startup
maxtel -D -p 2323 -n 4 -d /opt/maximus
```

## Interactive Mode

This is the default. When you launch MaxTel without `-H` or `-D`, it starts
the ncurses dashboard and you're immediately watching your BBS live. This is
the mode you want when you're sitting at a terminal — whether that's a local
console, an SSH session, or a `tmux` pane.

In interactive mode you can:

- Watch callers connect and disconnect in real time
- See what each node is doing (WFC, online, starting, stopping)
- View user details for any active session
- Snoop on sessions, kick users, restart nodes, or launch the config editor

Press `Q` to shut down. MaxTel will terminate all running nodes gracefully
before exiting.

commands (snoop, kick, restart, config), see

## Headless Mode

If you're running MaxTel on a headless server, inside a container, or under a
process supervisor like systemd, you don't need the dashboard. Pass `-H` to
skip the ncurses interface entirely:

```bash
maxtel -H -p 2323 -n 4
```

MaxTel prints a one-line confirmation to stderr and then runs silently:

![MaxTel Headless Output]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxtel-headless-output.png)

It still accepts connections, manages nodes, and writes to `maxtel.log` — you
just don't get the live UI. To stop it, send `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`:

```bash
kill $(pgrep maxtel)
```

### Running Under systemd

A minimal systemd unit file for headless MaxTel:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=MaxTel Telnet Supervisor
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/opt/maximus/bin/maxtel -H -p 2323 -n 4 -d /opt/maximus
WorkingDirectory=/opt/maximus
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save this as `/etc/systemd/system/maxtel.service`, then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now maxtel
```

Use `journalctl -u maxtel -f` to watch output, or `tail -f /opt/maximus/maxtel.log`
for MaxTel's own log.

---

## Daemon Mode

Daemon mode (`-D`) is the classic Unix approach: MaxTel forks to the
background, prints the child PID, and the parent exits. This implies headless
operation — there's no dashboard.

```bash
maxtel -D -p 2323 -n 4
```

Output:

```
maxtel daemon started (PID 12345), port 2323
```

This is convenient for simple startup scripts where you don't have systemd:

```bash
# In rc.local or a startup script
if ! pgrep -x maxtel > /dev/null; then
    /opt/maximus/bin/maxtel -D -p 2323 -n 4 -d /opt/maximus
fi
```

To stop the daemon:

```bash
kill $(pgrep maxtel)
```

> **Tip:** If you have systemd available, prefer headless mode (`-H`) with a
> systemd unit file instead of daemon mode. systemd handles restarts,
> logging, and process tracking more reliably than a bare fork.
