## What's Different from Legacy Maximus 3.0

If you're coming from an older Maximus 3.0 installation, here's the short
version of what changed.

### Configuration System

**Legacy (pre-2025):**
- Configuration stored in `.ctl` text files
- Compiled to binary `.prm` and `.dat` files via `silt` utility
- Required recompilation after every config change

**Modern (2025+):**
- Configuration stored in TOML files under `config/`
- No compilation step required
- Direct runtime parsing of TOML
- Legacy `.ctl` files can be converted via
  [maxcfg --export-nextgen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link maxcfg-cli.md %})

### Removed Components

- **SILT** — Configuration compiler (replaced by TOML runtime parsing)
- **SM** — OS/2 session manager (obsolete)
- **PRM files** — Binary compiled config format (replaced by TOML)

### What Still Works

- All BBS functionality (telnet, local console)
- MEX scripting language (now with JSON and socket intrinsics)
- MECCA display file compiler
- FidoNet message processing (Squish)
- File transfers
- Multi-node operation via MAXTEL

## Summary of Changes (Jan 30 - Apr 4, 2026)

A lot has happened since the 4.0 baseline landed. This whole stretch is still the 4.0 release train, just spread across multiple feature passes.

**The entire source tree got reorganized.** Code now lives in a clean `src/`
hierarchy, runtime assets in `resources/`, and all the DOS/OS2-era cruft that
nobody's touched in 20 years is gone. The build system was updated to match and
this is the foundation everything else builds on.

**Maximus now speaks TOML for everything.** The old binary language files
(`.mad`/`.ltf`/`.lth`) are retired. All 1,334 display strings live in
`english.toml`, editable with any text editor. There's a full converter for
migrating legacy language packs, a delta overlay system for theme colors, and
positional parameters (`|!1` through `|!F`) replace the old `printf`-style
`%s`/`%d` codes. MEX scripts can query language strings at runtime via new
`lang_get()` intrinsics.

**Lightbar everything.** Menus got a proper lightbar renderer. A classic
single-column, positioned multi-column, and a new `ui_select_prompt` for inline
selections. On top of that, the traditional canned menu system now supports
bounded rendering: you define a rectangle in your menu config and Maximus lays
out options inside it with configurable justification and spacing. File and
message areas got their own dedicated lightbar mode with division drill-in,
hierarchy navigation, configurable highlight styles, and optional custom screen
support.

**MaxCFG keeps getting better.** The config editor gained a full language string
browser/editor with TOML write-back, a shared MCI preview interpreter for
live-previewing display strings, and menu editing improvements for the new
lightbar and bounded layout features.

**New UI primitives — and they're all scriptable.** The lightbar list engine
(`ui_lightbar_list_run`) is a generic paged list with full keyboard nav. Input
fields (`ui_edit_field`) got centralized key decoding, forward-delete, format
masks, and start-mode control. There's a new struct-based form runner with 2D
spatial navigation across fields and required-field validation. Every one of
these primitives is fully exposed to MEX.

**MCI display codes expanded.** New terminal control codes, semantic theme color
stubs (the lowercase pipe namespace — `|tx`, `|pr`, `|hi`, etc.), deferred
parameter expansion (`|#N`) with format-op support, and rendering/attribute
fixes across the board.

**Runtime foundations for 4.0.** SQLite-backed user database, TOML-first
configuration via `libmaxcfg`, and Door32 support with automatic dropfile
generation. MAXTEL gained headless/daemon modes and interactive sysop features.

**Hardened input flows.** Remote login now enforces attempt limits on name,
city, alias, and password entry. Legacy DOS dropfile generators removed in favor
of native C dropfile support.

---

## Sat Apr 4 2026 — MaximusNG 4.0 [release prep]

**Deployment cleanup, Door32 follow-through, and MEX/UI runtime staging**

- Removed redundant `maxtel_install` calls from wrapper scripts because `make install` already deploys MAXTEL.
- Build cleanup now removes staged libs, root-level launcher/log leftovers, and generated `.bbs` cruft from `build/`.
- Install/release docs now include the MaxTel manuals, MaxCFG CLI docs, NG config docs, `squish.doc`, and `max_mast.txt`.
- Door32 now preserves its live session descriptor across exec chains, and the dropfile writes a numeric ANSI capability flag.
- Staged 4.0 content now includes updated games menu text, MaxNG welcome assets, and Smuggler runtime data.

## Fri Feb 21 2026 — MaximusNG 4.0 [development]

*Part of the MaximusNG 4.0 release train*

**Deferred MCI Params, Input Hardening, MEC Path Cleanup**

### New: Deferred Parameter Expansion (|#N)

- New `|#N` MCI codes for deferred parameter expansion during `MciExpand`
- Format ops (`$L`, `$R`, `$T`, `$C`) now apply to resolved `|#N` values

  be mixed in a single `LangPrintf` call

### Improved: Who-Is-On Display

- WFC/idle nodes shown with dim formatting via new `hu_is_on_4` lang string
- Active user and chat-available counts tracked and displayed
- `hu_is_on_3` uses deferred `|#N` for padded username and node number

### Improved: Input Hardening

- Name, city, alias, and password entry loops enforce a 3-attempt limit for
  remote callers
- Excess attempts trigger disconnect with log entry and `too_many_attempts`
  lang string

  `outside.mec`
- All superseded by native C dropfile support in `dropfile.c`

### Improved: Lightbar Area Selection

- `ListFileAreas`/`ListMsgAreas` return value now distinguishes selection vs.
  back-out

### Docs & Scripts

- New lightbar areas configuration guide
- Updated MCI codes and display codes documentation
- New `propagate_lang.sh` script for lang file sync across config trees
