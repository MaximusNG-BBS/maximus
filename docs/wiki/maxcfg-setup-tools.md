---

The **Setup** menu is where you configure the core personality of your BBS —
its name, paths, login behavior, color scheme, network settings, and security
levels. If you're setting up Maximus for the first time, this is where you'll
spend most of your initial configuration time. If you're an experienced sysop,
this is where you come back to tweak things.

All settings here are stored in TOML configuration files under `config/`.
Changes are held in memory as you work — nothing touches disk until you
explicitly save via **Tools → Save Configuration**.

---

## Global Submenu

The Global submenu covers the most fundamental settings: what your BBS is
called, where its files live, how logging works, and what happens when someone
logs in.

### BBS and Sysop Information

This is the identity of your board — the name callers see and the sysop name
that appears in system messages.

![MaxCFG BBS Information Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-setup-bbs-info.png)

| Field | Type | TOML Key |
|-------|------|----------|
| BBS Name | Text | `maximus.system_name` |
| Sysop Name | Text | `maximus.sysop_name` |
| Alias System | Toggle | `maximus.alias_system` |
| Ask for Alias | Toggle | `maximus.ask_alias` |
| Single Word Names | Toggle | `maximus.single_word_names` |
| Check ANSI | Toggle | `maximus.check_ansi` |
| Check RIP | Toggle | `maximus.check_rip` |

If you enable the **Alias System**, callers can use a handle instead of their
real name throughout the board. **Single Word Names** allows handles like
"Phoenix" instead of requiring "Phoenix Jones."

### System Paths

These tell Maximus where to find its various file directories. All paths are
normalized relative to your `sys_path`, so you can use relative paths like
`ansi/` instead of full absolute paths. The file picker (**F2**) is available
on every path field for browsing.

| Field | Type | TOML Key |
|-------|------|----------|
| Display Path | Path | `maximus.display_path` |
| Language Path | Path | `maximus.lang_path` |
| Temp Path | Path | `maximus.temp_path` |
| Node Path | Path | `maximus.ipc_path` |
| File Password | Path | `maximus.file_password` |
| File Access | Path | `maximus.file_access` |
| Log File | Path | `maximus.log_file` |

### Logging Options

| Field | Type | TOML Key |
|-------|------|----------|
| Log File | Path | `maximus.log_file` |
| Log Mode | Toggle (Terse/Verbose/Trace) | `maximus.log_mode` |

**Terse** logs logins, logoffs, and errors. **Verbose** adds individual
commands and area changes. **Trace** is for debugging — it logs everything,
including internal state transitions. Start with Verbose for a new board;
switch to Terse once things are running smoothly.

### Global Toggles

System-wide behavior switches:

| Field | Type | TOML Key |
|-------|------|----------|
| Snoop | Toggle | `maximus.snoop` |
| Password Encryption | Toggle | `maximus.encrypt_pw` |
| Watchdog/Reboot | Toggle | `maximus.reboot` |
| Swap to Disk | Toggle | `maximus.swap` |
| Local Keyboard Timeout | Toggle | `maximus.local_input_timeout` |
| Status Line | Toggle | `maximus.status_line` |

**Password Encryption** should be on for any production board — it hashes
passwords before storage so they can't be read from the database. **Snoop**
enables local monitoring of remote sessions. **Status Line** shows a sysop
info bar at the bottom of the local console.

> **Note:** The `maximus.swap` toggle has no runtime effect — SWAP support was
> removed from the Maximus NG engine. It remains in the UI for legacy config
> compatibility.

### Login Settings

These control what happens during the login process — who can log in, how long
they can stay, and what the board checks for at connect time.

| Field | Type | TOML Key |
|-------|------|----------|
| Logon Privilege | Select | `general.session.logon_priv` |
| Logon Time Limit | Number | `general.session.logon_time_limit` |
| Minimum Logon Baud | Number | `general.session.min_baud` |
| Minimum Graphics Baud | Number | `general.session.min_nontty_baud` |
| Minimum RIP Baud | Number | `general.session.min_rip_baud` |
| Input Timeout | Number | `general.session.input_timeout` |
| Check ANSI on Login | Toggle | `general.session.check_ansi` |
| Check RIP on Login | Toggle | `general.session.check_rip` |

The **Logon Privilege** field uses a privilege picker — press Enter or F2 to
open it, or Space to manually type a custom privilege string. The baud rate
fields are mostly relevant for dial-up setups; telnet-only boards can leave
them at their defaults.

### New User Defaults

When someone calls your board for the first time, these settings control what
they're asked and where they land:

| Field | Type | TOML Key |
|-------|------|----------|
| Ask for Phone Number | Toggle | `general.session.ask_phone` |
| Ask for Alias | Toggle | `general.session.ask_alias` |
| Alias System | Toggle | `general.session.alias_system` |
| Single Word Names | Toggle | `general.session.single_word` |
| No Real Name Required | Toggle | `general.session.no_realname` |
| First Menu | Text | `general.session.first_menu` |
| First File Area | Text | `general.session.first_file_area` |
| First Message Area | Text | `general.session.first_msg_area` |

**First Menu** is the menu new users see after registration. The default is
your MAIN menu, but some sysops point new users to a "welcome" or "newuser"
menu first.

### Display Files

Maximus shows display files at various points during a session — a logo when
someone connects, a welcome screen after login, a goodbye screen when they log
off, and so on. This form lists all ~40 display file mappings, one for each
event.

![MaxCFG Display Files Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-display-files-form.png)

Each field supports:

- **Enter / F2** — open the file picker to browse for `.bbs` or `.vm` files
- **Space** — manually type or edit the path

Paths are resolved relative to `sys_path`. MEX scripts (`.vm` files) are
resolved under `scripts/` — so you can use a MEX script as a dynamic
login screen, for example.

### Default Colors

Opens a category picker with four groups of color settings. These control the
default colors your callers see for menus, file listings, message displays, and
the full-screen reader. For more on how Maximus handles colors, see
[Theme Colors]({% link theme-colors.md %}).

![MaxCFG Default Colors Picker]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-default-color-picker.png)

| Category | What you're coloring |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Menu Colors** | Menu name, highlight, option text (foreground only) |
| **File Colors** | File name, size, date, description, offline indicator, new-file flag, area tag (foreground only) |
| **Message Colors** | From, To, Subject, Date, Body, Quote, Kludge, Origin, Tearline, Seenby, Header, Area Tag, Highlight (foreground only, scrollable list) |
| **Reader Colors** | Full-screen reader colors: Normal, High, Quote, Kludge, Status, Warning, MsgN, From, To (foreground + background) |

Each color field opens a picker. For foreground-only fields you choose from 16
colors. For FG+BG fields you get the full 16×8 grid.

## Matrix/Echomail Submenu

If you're running a FidoNet-connected board (or any echomail/netmail network),
this is where you configure the matrix — Maximus's term for the networking
layer that handles mail routing, privilege controls, and network addressing.

If you're running a standalone board with no network connections, you can skip
this section entirely.

### Matrix Privileges

| Field | Type | TOML Key |
|-------|------|----------|
| Logon Availability | Select | `matrix.logon_avail` |
| Matrix Entry | Select | `matrix.matrix_entry` |

These control who can use the matrix (network mail) features. The access level
names come from your `access_levels.toml` definitions.

### Message Attribute Privileges

A list editor for per-attribute privilege settings. Each entry maps a message
attribute (Private, Crash, Kill/Sent, etc.) to the minimum privilege level
needed to set that attribute when composing a message.

For example, you might restrict the "Crash" flag (which triggers immediate
netmail delivery) to Privileged users and above.

- **Enter** — edit the selected attribute's privilege
- **Insert** — add a new attribute rule
- **Delete** — remove the selected rule

### Network Addresses

A list editor for your FidoNet network addresses in Zone:Net/Node.Point
format. Most boards have one address; multi-net boards may have several.

![MaxCFG Network Addresses Editor]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-ftn-editor.png)

- **Enter** — edit the selected address
- **Insert** — add a new address
- **Delete** — remove the selected address

### Netmail Settings

| Field | Type | TOML Key |
|-------|------|----------|
| Nodelist Version | Text | `matrix.nodelist_ver` |
| Echotoss Name | Text | `matrix.echotoss_name` |
| FidoUser List | Text | `matrix.fidouser` |
| CTLA Privilege | Select | `matrix.ctla_priv` |
| SeenBy Privilege | Select | `matrix.seenby_priv` |

The **CTLA** and **SeenBy Privilege** fields control who can see the technical
kludge lines in echomail messages. Most sysops set these to Sysop or
Privileged — regular callers don't usually need to see routing information.

---

## Security Levels

Maximus uses a privilege-based access system. Each security level defines a
name, a numeric level, and a set of limits (session time, daily time, download
caps, etc.). When you assign a user a privilege level, they inherit all the
limits defined for that level.

The default setup includes levels like Demoted, Transient, Normal, Privileged,
and Sysop — but you can create as many custom levels as you need.

Press **Enter** to edit a level:

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| Name | Text |
| Level | Number |
| Description | Text |
| Session Time | Number (minutes) |
| Daily Time | Number (minutes) |
| Download Limit | Number (KB) |
| Min Baud | Number |
| Max Baud | Number |
| Login File | Path |
| Flags | Text |

> **Note:** Security level editing currently uses sample data. Full persistence
> will be added in a future release.

---

## Events

Events let you trigger external programs or BBS restarts at specific points in
the login cycle. Each event is defined as an exit error code — when the
condition occurs, Maximus exits with that code, and your wrapper script or
process manager can take action.

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| After Local Logon | Number (exit code) |
| After Matrix Logon | Number (exit code) |
| After Matrix Mail | Number (exit code) |

This is most commonly used for running mail tossers after inbound netmail, or
triggering maintenance scripts after a local sysop session.

---

## Protocols

External file transfer protocols — Zmodem, Ymodem, custom scripts — are
defined here. Maximus supports up to 64 protocol definitions. When a caller
initiates a file transfer, they choose from the protocols you've defined.

Press **Enter** to edit a protocol:

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Name | Text | What callers see in the protocol selection menu |
| Program (Upload) | Text | Command line for receiving files |
| Program (Download) | Text | Command line for sending files |
| Batch Mode | Toggle | Supports multiple files in one transfer |
| Bi-directional | Toggle | Supports simultaneous send/receive |
| Log File | Path | Where the protocol logs its activity |
| Control File | Path | File listing for batch transfers |
| Download Keyword | Text | Log keyword indicating a successful download |
| Upload Keyword | Text | Log keyword indicating a successful upload |
| File Keyword | Text | Log keyword for the filename |
| Bytes Keyword | Text | Log keyword for bytes transferred |
| CPS Keyword | Text | Log keyword for transfer speed |

The keyword fields tell Maximus how to parse the protocol's log file to
track transfer statistics. If you're using a well-known protocol like
DSZ/Zmodem, the defaults should work. Custom protocols may need adjustment.

## Tools Menu

### Save Configuration

This is the big one. When you select **Tools → Save Configuration**, MaxCFG
writes all your in-memory TOML changes to disk. Everything you've edited in
Setup, Content, Messages, and Files gets committed.

Note that area editors and the user editor save their changes immediately (not
deferred to this step), so Save Configuration covers only the TOML-backed
system settings.

> **Don't forget to save before exiting!** If you close MaxCFG without saving,
> your TOML setting changes are lost. Area and user changes are safe — they
> saved when you exited those editors.

## Bad Users and Reserved Names

These are simple text-list editors accessible from the **Users** menu.

### Bad Users

**Path:** `etc/baduser.bbs`

A list of usernames that will be rejected at login. If someone tries to log in
with a name on this list, they're turned away. Use this for banning
troublemakers.

- **Enter** — edit the selected name
- **Insert** — add a new name
- **Delete** — remove the selected name
- **Esc** — save and exit

### Reserved Names

**Path:** `etc/reserved.bbs`

A list of names that can't be used for new user registration. This prevents
callers from creating accounts with names like "Sysop", "Guest", "Admin", or
your board's name. Same interface as Bad Users.
