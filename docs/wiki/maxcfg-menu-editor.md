The menu system is the face of your BBS — it's the first thing callers interact
with and the last thing they see before logging off. MaxCFG's built-in menu
editor lets you design, tweak, and **preview your menus live** without ever
leaving the configuration tool. You can see exactly what your callers will see,
with full ANSI art rendering, lightbar colors, and layout — all updated in
real-time as you make changes. Hit **F3** from any menu form and there it is.
([Jump to Live Preview details.](#live-preview))

Each menu lives in its own TOML file under `config/menus/` (e.g., `main.toml`,
`message.toml`, `file.toml`). No compilation step, no separate tools. Open a
menu, change a title, add an option, save, done.

---

## Opening the Menu Editor

From the maxcfg main screen, navigate to:

**Content → Menus**

MaxCFG reads the menu TOML files from `config/menus/` and presents every defined menu in a list.
If you're coming from another BBS package or setting up Maximus for the first
time, you'll find a set of default menus already in place — MAIN, MESSAGE,
FILE, CHANGE, EDIT, CHAT, and so on. These are a good starting point; you can
rename, rearrange, or replace them as you see fit.

---

## Menu List

![MaxCFG Menu List]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-menu-list.png)

Each entry shows the menu name, the title your callers see, and how many
options it contains.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Enter** | Edit the selected menu |
| **Insert** | Create a new menu |
| **Delete** | Remove the selected menu (asks for confirmation first) |
| **Esc** | Save all menus back to their TOML files and exit |

---

## Menu Properties

When you select a menu, the properties form opens. This is where you set the
basics — what the menu is called, what files it displays, and how wide the
auto-generated option list should be.

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Name** | Text | The internal menu name (e.g., `MAIN`). Must be unique across all menus. |
| **Title** | Text | What callers see at the top. You can use `%t` for time remaining, and other Maximus tokens. |
| **HeaderFile** | File | A display file shown once when a caller first enters the menu (think: a welcome banner). |
| **HeaderFile Types** | Multiselect | Which help levels see the header: Novice, Regular, Expert, RIP. |
| **MenuFile** | File | A custom ANSI/BBS file that replaces the auto-generated option list. This is how you get those beautiful full-screen menus. |
| **MenuFile Types** | Multiselect | Which help levels see the custom menu file. |
| **MenuLength** | Number | How many screen lines your MenuFile takes up. Maximus needs this so it knows where to put the prompt. |
| **OptionWidth** | Number | Width for each option in the auto-generated list (6–80, default 20). |
| **HotColour** | Number | Color code for hotkey highlighting (-1 = none). |
| **Customize...** | Action | Opens the customization sub-form — this is where the magic happens. |
| **Menu Options (N defined)** | Action | Opens the option list editor. |

> **The big feature:** Press **F3** from this form for a
> [live preview](#live-preview) of exactly what your callers will see.

## Customization

Here's where Maximus NG really shines. The customization sub-form lets you
combine a full-screen ANSI art background with Maximus's auto-generated option
list — positioned, colored, and laid out exactly the way you want. You can
build menus that look like custom ANSI art but still have Maximus handle the
option rendering, hotkeys, and even arrow-key lightbar navigation automatically.

If you've ever wanted the look of hand-crafted ANSI menus without maintaining
them by hand every time you add an option — this is it.

For the full deep-dive on how hybrid menus work, see
[Lightbar Menus]({% link config-lightbar-menus.md %}) and
[Canned & Bounded Menus]({% link config-canned-bounded-menus.md %}).

![MaxCFG Menu Customization Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-menu-customize.png)

### Toggles

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Enable Customization** | Master switch. Nothing below takes effect until this is on. |
| **Skip Canned** | Don't generate the option list at all — your MenuFile is the entire menu. Useful for pure ANSI art menus where you handle everything with hotkeys. |
| **Show Title** | Print the menu title inside the bounded area. |
| **Lightbar** | Enable arrow-key lightbar navigation. Callers can arrow up/down through the options instead of typing hotkeys. |
| **Lightbar Margin** | Padding (in characters) around each lightbar item. A little breathing room goes a long way. |

### Boundary

The boundary defines a rectangle on screen where the auto-generated option list
appears. Think of it as a window cut into your ANSI art. Coordinates are
1-based (row, column).

| Field | What it sets |
|-------|-------------|
| **Top Row / Top Col** | Upper-left corner of the option area |
| **Bottom Row / Bottom Col** | Lower-right corner |
| **Title Row / Title Col** | Where the menu title text goes |
| **Prompt Row / Prompt Col** | Where the input prompt sits |

Getting these numbers right is the key to a good-looking hybrid menu. Use the
[live preview](#live-preview) (**F3**) to dial them in — you can tweak a value,
hit F3, and immediately see whether your options land in the right spot.

### Layout

| Field | Options | What it controls |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Option Spacing** | Toggle | Extra blank line between option rows — gives a more spacious feel. |
| **Option Justify** | Left / Center / Right | Horizontal alignment of option text within the boundary. |
| **Boundary Justify** | Left Top, Center Center, etc. | How the option block is positioned within the boundary rectangle. |
| **Boundary Layout** | Grid, Tight, Spread, Spread Width, Spread Height | How options fill the bounded area. "Spread" distributes them evenly; "Grid" packs them into columns. |

### Lightbar Colors

Four color pairs let you control exactly how the lightbar looks. Each one opens
a 16×8 color picker when you select it — pick a foreground, pick a background,
and you'll see the result immediately in the [live preview](#live-preview).

| Field | What it controls |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Normal Color** | Default text for unselected options |
| **Selected Color** | The highlight bar on the currently selected option |
| **High Color** | The hotkey character in unselected options (so it stands out) |
| **High+Selected Color** | The hotkey character when the option is highlighted |

Colors are stored as named pairs (e.g., "White on Blue") in the
`[custom_menu.lightbar_color]` section of the menu's TOML file.

### What It Looks Like in TOML

If you're curious what all this produces, here's an excerpt from a real
`main.toml` with customization enabled:

```toml
name = "MAIN"
title = "Main menu (%t mins)"
menu_file = "display/screens/menu_main.ans"
menu_types = ["Novice"]
option_width = 14

[[option]]
command = "Display_Menu"
arguments = "MESSAGE"
priv_level = "Demoted"
description = "Message areas"
modifiers = []

[[option]]
command = "Goodbye"
arguments = ""
priv_level = "Transient"
description = "Goodbye (log off)"
modifiers = []

# ... more [[option]] entries ...

[custom_menu]
skip_canned_menu = false
show_title = true
lightbar_menu = true
lightbar_margin = 1
top_boundary = [8, 8]
bottom_boundary = [20, 61]
title_location = [22, 32]
prompt_location = [23, 1]
boundary_layout = "spread"
boundary_justify = "center center"

[custom_menu.lightbar_color]
normal = ["Light Gray", "Black"]
high = ["Yellow", "Black"]
selected = ["White", "Blue"]
high_selected = ["Yellow", "Blue"]
```

You never have to write this by hand — the menu editor builds it for you. But
it's nice to know it's all plain-text TOML if you ever want to bulk-edit or
version-control your menus.

## Menu Options

Every menu is made up of options — the commands your callers can choose from.
The option list shows them all at a glance:

![MaxCFG Menu Options List]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-menu-options.png)

Each line shows the description callers see, the command it runs, and the
minimum privilege level needed to use it. Options appear in the order callers
see them — the order in this list is the order on screen.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Enter** | Edit the selected option |
| **Insert** | Add a new option at the current position |
| **Delete** | Remove the selected option (asks for confirmation) |
| **Esc** | Return to the properties form |

### Option Editor

Select an option and you get a form with everything that defines it:

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Command** | Select | What this option actually does. Opens a command picker grouped by category. |
| **Arguments** | Select/Text | For `Display_Menu`, press F2 to pick from your menu list. For other commands, type freely. |
| **Privilege** | Select | Minimum access level. Opens a picker with your defined levels, or press Space to type a custom string like `Normal/1C`. |
| **Description** | Text | The text callers see. The first character automatically becomes the hotkey. |
| **Hotkey** | Text | Override the auto-hotkey if you want a different key. |
| **Modifiers** | Multiselect | Special behavior flags (see below). |

### Command Picker

You don't have to memorize command names — the picker groups them by category:

![MaxCFG Command Picker]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-menu-select-cmd.png)

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Misc** | Display_Menu, Display_File, MEX, Link_Menu, Cls, If, Return, Key_Poke |
| **External** | Xtern_Erlvl, Xtern_Dos, Xtern_Run, Xtern_Chain, Xtern_Concur |
| **Main** | Goodbye, Statistics, Yell, Userlist, Version, User_Editor |
| **Message** | Msg_Area, Read_Next, Enter_Message, Msg_Reply, Msg_List, Msg_Browse, Msg_Tag |
| **File** | File_Area, Locate, File_Titles, Upload, Download, File_Tag, Newfiles |
| **Change** | Chg_City, Chg_Password, Chg_Help, Chg_Video, Chg_Editor, Chg_Protocol |
| **Edit** | Edit_Save, Edit_Abort, Edit_List, Edit_Edit, Edit_Insert |
| **Chat** | Who_Is_On, Page, Chat_CB, Chat_Toggle, Chat_Pvt |

### Modifier Flags

Modifiers change how an option behaves without changing the command itself:

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **NoDsp** | Hides the option from the menu display, but callers can still use the hotkey. Great for secret sysop commands or shortcut aliases. |
| **NoCLS** | Don't clear the screen when chaining to another menu (Display_Menu only). |
| **RIP** | Only show to callers with RIP graphics. |
| **NoRIP** | Only show to callers *without* RIP graphics. |
| **Local** | Only show when the area is a local-style area. |
| **UsrLocal** | Only show to locally connected users (console). |
| **UsrRemote** | Only show to remote (telnet/modem) users. |
| **ReRead** | Re-read the user record after an external program returns. Use this when a door game might change user data. |

### Privilege Levels

The privilege picker shows the standard levels defined in your `access.ctl`:

- **Demoted** — the lowest level; everyone can see and use the option
- **Transient** — temporary/guest access
- **Normal** — your everyday registered user
- **Privileged** — elevated access (co-sysops, trusted users)
- **Sysop** — full system access
- **Hidden** — invisible to regular users entirely

You can also type custom privilege strings with key restrictions. For example,
`Normal/1C` means "Normal level, but only if the user has keys 1 and C set."
This gives you fine-grained control over who sees what.

## Live Preview

This is one of the best features of the menu editor. Press **F3** from the
properties form or the customization form, and MaxCFG renders your menu
*exactly* as a caller would see it — right there in a popup window.

![MaxCFG Live Menu Preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-live-preview.png)

Here's what happens under the hood:

1. If you have a MenuFile (ANSI art), it's rendered with full MCI color
   translation — pipe codes, cursor positioning, the works.
2. The auto-generated option list is overlaid within your boundary rectangle.
3. Lightbar colors and layout settings are applied from whatever you have in
   the form *right now* — even before you've saved.
4. The result pops up on screen.

This means you can tweak a boundary coordinate, hit F3, see if it looks right,
adjust, hit F3 again — a fast, visual feedback loop. No more guessing at row
numbers, saving, restarting the BBS, and logging in to check. You see it
instantly.

## Tips

**Start with ANSI art.** The most impressive menus combine a hand-drawn ANSI
background (set as the MenuFile) with a bounded option area. Draw your art in
your favorite ANSI editor, leave a blank region for options, then use the
boundary settings to fill it in. The [live preview](#live-preview) makes
dialing in the coordinates painless.

**Use NoDsp for hidden commands.** Want a hotkey that works but doesn't appear
on the menu? Add the NoDsp modifier. This is how experienced sysops add things
like quick-jump shortcuts or secret sysop backdoors.

**Test at different privilege levels.** Options with higher privilege
requirements are invisible to users below that level. Your MAIN menu might look
quite different to a Demoted guest versus a Sysop. Use the preview to think
about what each class of user sees.

**Don't delete the EDIT menu.** Maximus requires a menu named `EDIT` for its
built-in message editor. If you remove it, message editing breaks. You can
customize its options all you want, just keep the menu itself.

**Explore the customization features.** If you haven't tried lightbar
navigation yet, turn it on for your MAIN menu and see how it feels. Between
the boundary system, layout options, and per-menu colors, you can make every
menu on your BBS look and feel distinct. See
[Lightbar Menus]({% link config-lightbar-menus.md %}) and
[Canned & Bounded Menus]({% link config-canned-bounded-menus.md %}) for the
full story on what's possible.
