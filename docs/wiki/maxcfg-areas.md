Areas are the heart of any BBS. Message areas are where your callers read and
write messages — local discussions, FidoNet echomail, private netmail. File
areas are where they browse and download files. How you organize these areas
determines what your board feels like to use.

Maximus organizes areas into **divisions** — think of them as folders or
categories. A division called "FidoNet Echo" might contain areas like
BBS_CARNIVAL, LINUX, and RETRO_COMPUTING. A division called "Local" might
hold your board's own chat areas. Divisions can be nested (a division inside a
division), which is handy if you have a lot of areas and want to group them
into sub-categories.

MaxCFG gives you three ways to work with this structure: a **tree view** that
shows the full hierarchy, a **division picklist** for working with divisions
directly, and an **area picklist** for editing individual areas. All three
read from and write to the same TOML area files.

---

## Area Files

| Area Type | TOML File |
|-----------|-----------|
| Message areas | `config/areas/msg/areas.toml` |
| File areas | `config/areas/file/areas.toml` |

These files are loaded on demand when you first open a Messages or Files screen
in MaxCFG. Changes are saved back to the TOML file when you exit the view.

---

## Tree View

**Messages → Tree Config** or **Files → Tree Config**

The tree view is the best way to see the big picture. It shows every division
and every area in a collapsible hierarchy — similar to a file manager's folder
tree.

![MaxCFG Message Area Tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-msg-area-tree.png)

Divisions are shown with their child areas nested beneath them. Areas are indented
under their parent division.

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Up / Down** | Move between nodes |
| **Right** | Expand a collapsed division |
| **Left** | Collapse an expanded division |
| **Enter** | Edit the selected node (division or area) |
| **Insert** | Add a new sibling at the current level |
| **Delete** | Toggle the selected node enabled/disabled |
| **Esc** | Save and exit |

This is the view to use when you're reorganizing — adding new divisions,
moving areas around, or getting a feel for how callers will navigate your
board's area structure.

## Division Picklist

**Messages → Message Divisions** or **Files → File Divisions**

If you just want to edit divisions without seeing the full tree, the division
picklist shows them as a flat list:

```
┌─ Message Divisions ─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  General Discussion          Level 1    4 areas              │
│  FidoNet Echo                Level 1    3 areas              │
│  Netmail                     Level 1    1 area               │
│                                                              │
│  [Enter] Edit  [Ins] Add  [Del] Toggle  [Esc] Save & Exit   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Enter** | Edit the selected division |
| **Insert** | Add a new division |
| **Delete** | Toggle enabled/disabled |
| **Esc** | Save and exit |

### Division Form

Divisions are simple — they're mostly about naming and access control:

**Message Division:**

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Name | Text | What callers see when browsing areas (keep it short and clear) |
| Description | Text | Optional longer description |
| ACS | Select | Minimum access level to see this division and its areas |
| Level | Number | Nesting depth — 1 for top-level, 2 for a sub-division, etc. |

**File Division** has the same fields, plus:

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Download Path | Path | Default download directory for areas in this division |
| Upload Path | Path | Default upload directory for areas in this division |

Setting paths on a division is a nice shortcut — any new areas you create under
it will inherit those paths as defaults, so you don't have to type them for
every area.

---

## Area Picklist

**Messages → Message Areas** or **Files → File Areas**

This is the flat list of every area on your board, across all divisions. It's
the fastest way to find and edit a specific area.

![MaxCFG Message Area Flat List]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-areas-flatpicker.png)

Each entry shows the area name, type, and description.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Enter** | Edit the selected area |
| **Insert** | Add a new area |
| **Delete** | Toggle enabled/disabled |
| **Esc** | Save and exit |

### Message Area Form

When you edit a message area, here's what you're working with:

![MaxCFG Message Area Edit Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/screenshots/maxcfg-msg-area-edit.png)

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Tag | Text | A short identifier used internally and in echomail (e.g., `BBS_CARNIVAL`). Must be unique. |
| Name | Text | The display name callers see when browsing areas |
| Description | Text | A longer description, shown in area listings |
| ACS | Select | Minimum access level to see and use this area |
| Division | Select | Which division this area belongs to |
| Style | Select | Message base format: **Squish** (recommended) or **MSG** (legacy Hudson/FTS-1) |
| Type | Select | **Local** (board-only), **Echo** (FidoNet echomail), **Net** (netmail), or **Conference** |
| Scope | Select | **Public** or **Private** |
| Path | Path | Where the message base files live on disk |
| Origin | Text | The origin line appended to outbound echo/net messages (your board's signature) |
| Max Messages | Number | Maximum messages before the base wraps (oldest messages are purged) |
| System Flags | Multiselect | System-level behavior flags |
| Mail Flags | Multiselect | Mail processing flags |

If you're new to Maximus: **Squish** is the modern message base format — it's
faster and more compact than MSG. Use it unless you have a specific reason not
to. The **Type** field matters most for FidoNet boards: "Local" means messages
stay on your board, "Echo" means they're tossed to the echomail network.

### File Area Form

| Field | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Tag | Text | Short area identifier (must be unique) |
| Name | Text | Display name callers see |
| Description | Text | Longer description for area listings |
| ACS | Select | Minimum access level |
| Division | Select | Parent division |
| Download Path | Path | Where downloadable files live on disk |
| Upload Path | Path | Where uploaded files land |
| FileList Path | Path | Path to the file listing database |
| Max Files | Number | Maximum files in the area |
| System Flags | Multiselect | System behavior flags |

## Enabling and Disabling

Press **Delete** on any division or area to toggle it between enabled and
disabled. Disabled items are shown dimmed in the list. They stay in the TOML
file — they're just skipped when the BBS loads at startup.

This is much safer than actually deleting an area. The configuration is
preserved, and you can re-enable it any time. It's a good approach for seasonal
areas, areas you're testing, or areas you want to temporarily hide.

---

## How Changes Are Saved

Area changes are saved **directly to the TOML file** when you exit any of the
three views (tree, division picklist, or area picklist). This is different from
the Setup menu, where changes sit in memory until you use
**Tools → Save Configuration**.

The reason for this is practical: area files can be large, and you typically
want your changes committed right away. After saving, MaxCFG reloads the area
tree from disk the next time you open an area view, so you always see the
latest state.

---

## Tips

**Use the tree view for reorganizing.** When you need to see the big picture —
which divisions hold which areas, how deep the nesting goes, what the caller's
navigation path looks like — the tree view is the right tool.

**Use the picklists for editing.** When you need to quickly change settings on
a bunch of areas (updating paths, tweaking access levels), the flat area
picklist is faster than expanding and collapsing tree nodes.

**Keep division names short and clear.** Your callers see these names when
they're picking which area to enter. "FidoNet Echo" is better than
"FidoNet Echomail Discussion Areas (International)."

**Set default paths on file divisions.** If all the file areas in a division
share the same download/upload directory, set it on the division once. New areas
inherit those paths, saving you from typing the same path over and over.

**Disable instead of deleting.** If you're not sure whether you want to keep
an area, disable it instead of removing it. You can always bring it back.
